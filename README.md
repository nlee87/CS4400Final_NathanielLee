# CS4400Final_NathanielLee

Project Solution Nathaniel Lee.py contains the code for my project solution, and the data folder contains the relevant tables. 
Not included in this repository is the text file containing GloVe word vectors, which can be downloaded from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/.
I used the Wikipedia 2014 + Gigawords 5 set, specifically the 50d version named glove.6b.50d.txt.
